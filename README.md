## About The Project

This plugin was developed to address a common challenge in education: students often use AI as an 'answer vending machine' without engaging in a deeper learning process. This plugin formalizes the process of learning with AI by integrating prompt/response journaling directly into Obsidian.

By creating a structured workflow within a student's personal knowledge base, it allows for streamlined recording of AI conversations, AI-powered summarization of the student's thought processes, and evaluation of their growth in prompt engineering and metacognition over time. It is designed specifically for students in fields like Instructional Design & Technology (IDT) but is useful for any learner wanting to be more intentional in their use of AI.
